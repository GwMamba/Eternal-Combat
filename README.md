## Introduction

Eternal Combat is a multiplayer game set on various arena. Inspired by a whole genre of fighting games, it takes inspiration from the first ever release of Street Fighter in 1987. With one of its creators being credited in the 2023 release of Street Fighter 6, it was a homage to a time when gaming was so simple, yet so rewarding. We hope to inspire a new generation of game makers with our version of it. Enjoy!

## Completed Features

- Gameplay: Currently a work in progress, this feature aims to facilitate play between two fighters.

- Game Timer: We've implemented a timer that counts donw for a minute and will result in a score based on the percentage hit points each fighter has by the end, should it be equal, the match will result in a Tie.
